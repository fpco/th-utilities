-- | This module implements a system for registering and using typeclass
-- derivers and instantiators. This allows you to derive instances for
-- typeclasses beyond GHC's ability to generate instances in @deriving@
-- clauses.
--
-- For example, "TH.Derive.Storable" defines a 'Deriver' for 'Storable'.
-- This allows us to use 'derive' to generate an instance for Storable:
--
-- @
--     data X = X Int Float
--
--     $($(derive [d|
--         instance Deriving (Storable X)
--         |]))
-- @
--
-- In particular, note the use of double splicing, @$($(derive [d| ...
-- |]))@. The inner @$(derive [d| ... |])@ expression generates code
-- which invokes the 'runDeriver' method with appropriate arguments. The
-- outer @$( ... $)@ then runs that code in order to generate the
-- resulting instances. This is how it does dispatch at compile time.
--
-- There are a number of advantages of re-using instance syntax in this
-- way:
--
-- * It allows the user to specify constraints. Similarly to GHC's need
-- for standalone deriving, it is sometimes very difficult for TH to
-- figure out appropriate superclass constraints.
--
-- * The instance gets thoroughly checked by GHC (syntax, kind, and type
-- checking). This means that you get reasonably nice error messages
-- when you misuse these.
--
-- * It allows the user to specify methods. With 'Instantiator's, the
-- user can provide values which can be used in the definition of the
-- generated instance. This is a bit like having
-- <https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/InstanceTemplates Instance Templates>.
-- We don't have pretty ways of writing these quite yet, but
-- I have worked on something
-- <https://github.com/mgsloan/instance-templates similar in the past>.
--
-- * Using compile-time dispatch allows for concise specification of a
-- multiple of instances you'd like derived.
--
-- * In the case of use of a 'Deriver's, the user doesn't need to know
-- about anything but 'derive' and the name of the class they want. (and
-- the 'Deriver' instance must be in scope one way or another)

-- | Useful function for defining 'Instantiator' instances. It uses

-- 'Name's. This is handy when you are putting the definitions passed to
-- the instantiator in a where clause. It is also useful so that you can
-- reference the class methods from AST quotes involved in the
-- definition of the instantiator.
